# Optimization practice

This practice consists in the creation of the front end for a web contact list. Also some different ways to optimize its loading time and memory usage are implemented. One of them is compressing the image files. An online compressor was used (https://compressjpeg.com/, also a version for the png), helping reduce some of the pictures to half its size. Another one is using a code compressor like jscompressor.com
